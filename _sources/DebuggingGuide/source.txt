Source Code and License
=======================

zBug is a completely open-source project licensed under the BSD 2-clause license and based on our Chief Architect Peter Zion's `original zBug project <https://github.com/pzion/zBug>`_. More details and a link to the license itself can be found in our `Fabric zBug repository <https://github.com/fabric-engine/zBug>`_ on github.

We also provide access to our custom `LLDB repository <https://github.com/fabric-engine/lldb>`_. We try to submit all of our patches to the main LLDB repository to keep ourselves as close to LLDB trunk as possible but there can always be differences so changes can be pulled directly from our repository if you want the latest code we're shipping.

Feel free to make any additions or modifications to the debugger and share them on the Fabric Engine mailing list, if we like them and you're willing to share we'd be glad to integrate any interesting ones into zBug itself!
