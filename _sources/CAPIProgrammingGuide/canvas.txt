Canvas Core API
====================

The Canvas Core API is the lowest-level interface at which Canvas can be
used.  The API is designed for use by a visual programming interface,
but can be driven directly by scripting.

The objects that are used by the Canvas Core API generally start with the
the letters :code:`DFG` for historical reasons.  Occasionally Canvas may
be referred to as "the DFG" in documentation.

The main classes that the Canvas Core API exposes are:

- :code:`FabricCore::DFGHost`: this object manages everything shared between
  different Canvas executables and bindings, such as the undo/redo stack and
  the preset tree, and is also the interface to use to create new bindings.

- :code:`FabricCore::DFGBinding`: this object is a binding of an executable
  to a set of arguments, and is the interface for actually computing things
  in Canvas.  The executable that it binds may be a very complex graph with
  subgraphs, but fundamentally all computation happens at the level of
  bindings.

- :code:`FabricCore::DFGExec`: this object is a Canvas executable, which
  can be either a graph of nodes or a KL function.

Each of these objects has its API details laid out below.

Canvas Core API in Python
-----------------------------

Note that the entire Canvas Core API is also available in Python through the
FabricEngine.Core module.  The calls are 1-1 with the CAPI calls.  For examples
of using the Python API to access the Canvas Core, please refer to the
Canvas Core unit tests located under :file:`$FABRIC_DIR/Test/Core/Canvas`.

      through their preset path and/or GUID, while locally-defined graphs and
      functions are encoded inline.  The values of the binding argument and the default values
      of ports are also encoded, provided that the RTVal codecs provided to the
      Core are able to encode them; see the Core client constructors for details.

    .. cpp:function:: void deallocValues()

      Gets a named metadata value associated with the binding.  The key is case-sensitive,
      and if there is no metadata present for the given key this function
      returns the empty string.  See :cpp:func:`FabricCore::DFGBinding::setMetdata`.

      :param key: The key for the metadata to obtain

      case-sensitive.  The current value for the key, if any, will be replaced.

      action should be undoable; if it is not undoable then no undo action will
      be stored and then the previous value of the metadata for the key will
      not be restored when an undo occurs.

      :param key: The key for the metadata to obtain
      :param value: The new value for the metadata

      when the binding is first created, and is incremented every time the binding
      changes.  The binding version changes are undone when actions on the binding
      are undone.  The purpose of the version is to allow applications to know
      when the binding has changed and may need to be saved.  Note that the binding
      version is not persisted when the binding is persisted.

      :result: The version of the binding
