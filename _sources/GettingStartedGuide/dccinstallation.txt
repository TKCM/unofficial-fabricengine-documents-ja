.. _GETTINGSTARTED_DCCINSTALLATION:

Installing the Fabric DCC Integrations
=========================================================

As mentioned in the :ref:`GETTINGSTARTED_BASEINSTALLATION` section, |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| relies on several environment variables. These have to be set up differently for each DCC in order to ensure a seamless integration of |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME|. This document assumes that the :envvar:`FABRIC_DIR` main environment variable is set to the location of the |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| archive extraction folder. On Windows you can also set these environment variables through the `Control Panel (see this link) <https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sysdm_advancd_environmnt_addchange_variable.mspx?mfr=true>`_. 

.. note:: On Windows, with the standard prompt, use set instead of export. 

Installing Fabric for Maya
-----------------------------------------------------

The Fabric for Maya plugin is shipped as a standard plugin module. In order for Maya to find the plugin module, the environment variable :envvar:`MAYA_MODULE_PATH` needs to be set before Maya is launched and it should point to the folder which contains the FabricMaya.mod file (which contains the relative paths to the KL Types (RT), Extensions (Exts) and UI files). You can manually set this variable like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  export MAYA_MODULE_PATH=$FABRIC_DIR/DCCIntegrations/FabricMaya<version>

Where `<version>` is the version of Maya being used.

You may of course also use an absolute path, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

  export MAYA_MODULE_PATH=c:/Users/MyUser/Download/FabricEngine-pablo-Windows-x86_64/DCCIntegrations/FabricMaya<version>

.. note:: The absolute path above may not apply to your installation. Also, on Windows, there should be no trailing slash on the MAYA_MODULE_PATH, otherwise Maya may fail to properly locate the plugin.

You can also use the `Maya.env <http://download.autodesk.com/global/docs/maya2014/en_us/index.html?url=files/Environment_Variables_Setting_environment_variables_using_Maya.env.htm,topicNumber=d30e149076>`_ file to set up the MAYA_MODULE_PATH.

Once in Maya, go to Window > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager window to load the FabricMaya plugin.

To make use of the python client the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` is automatically extended with the :dfn:`Python/PYTHON_VERSION` subfolder of the Maya module. 

Installing Fabric for Softimage
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Fabric for Softimage plugin is shipped as a standard workgroup. To load the workgroup simply open the Plugin Manager, click on the Workgroups Tab, and connect to the Workgroup extracted location.

In order to have the Softimage plugin working properly, these additional environment variables must be defined:

.. code-block:: bash

    export FABRIC_EXTS_PATH=$FABRIC_DIR/Exts
    export FABRIC_DFG_PATH=$FABRIC_DIR/Presets

To make use of the python client (which is able to access the same data through the python interface) the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` has to include the :dfn:`Python/PYTHON_VERSION` subfolder of the Fabric for Softimage workgroup. Depending on your operating system it might be required to add the location of the FabricCore-|FABRIC_VERSION| library to your :envvar:`PATH` or the :envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
